# MICROBLOG
* A basic microblog website under development.
* Done using Python and the Flask framework.
* Just a simple web application that allows users:
    + to register and login
    + post content
    + follow and view other users' posts
* Deployed at: https://sample-microblog.herokuapp.com/

#### NOTE:
Search function does not work in the deployed version since third party add-ons are not available to heroku accounts without linked credit cards.
